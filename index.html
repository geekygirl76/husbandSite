                <h5>Dr. David Rosenstein, D.C.</h5>
                <p class="introduction-p">
                  Dr. David S. Rosenstein has been the Official Chiropractor at the Westwood Health and Fitness Center for over 31 years, serving the Pascack Valley Community.
                </p>
                <p class="introduction-p">
                  With the "golden hands" of a trained fine artist, Dr. Rosenstein gently balances the spine using low force techniques in a non-rushed office environment. The experience is often described as very stress reducing, healing and relaxing. This process allows the body to better deal with its challenges and heal itself.
                </p>
                <p class="introduction-p">
                  Easy to talk to with straight to the point answers and solutions, Dr. Rosenstein invites you to phone him to discuss your problem. Whether you suffer from back or neck pain, auto, sports and work related injuries or just wish to regain and maintain your health, Chiropractic is the right choice for you!
                </p>
                <p class="introduction-p">
                  Both Health club members and Non-members are welcome! Typical wait time to see the doctor is usually never more than 0-10 minutes. Most insurances are accepted and home visits are also offered.

                          As a Chiropractor myself for 34 years I can attest to the skill
                          and professionalism rendered by Dr.David. I have received
                          adjustments from many over the years and can truly state his was
                           one of the best!

                          I have been to five chiropractors over the course of my life.
                          Dave Rosenstein is by far the best for a number of reasons.
                          He is extremely responsive to the individual needs of each patient
                          and adjusts his treatments accordingly.  There is no pressure that
                           I had found with the other chiropractors to make more appointments
                            than I feel comfortable with, buy vitamins that I don’t feel I need,
                             and other examples of a “hard sell”.  In fact, over the fifteen or
                             so years that I have been his patient we have become friends and
                             know and appreciate each other’s interests and opinions.  Both my
                              husband and son have been treated by Dr. Rosenstein and have had
                               good results also.  I can’t recommend him enough!

                          Dr. Rosenstein is an amazing doctor. I always leave his office feeling
                           like a million bucks. He is just a super nice person on top of being
                           a highly skilled professional. A+++

                          I am a massage therapist for 7 years and I have been to 11 chiropractors
                           and Dr. Rosenstein was the only one who could help me with my issues.
                            He also gives me a spinal massage working the trigger points before the
                            adjustment and takes more time with me. Not just a quick adjustment which
                            I had before. I even bring in my family.

                          My family and I have been patients of Dr. Rosenstein for numerous years.
                          His treatments are very gentle and he takes the time to address everyone's
                          individual problems.  He is great with the kids and they enjoy their regular
                          check-ups.  At a time where most doctors rush you in and out of their office,
                          he takes the time to listen and respond to our questions.  We feel that his
                          care has kept our family much healthier.

                          As a yoga practitioner, marathon runner and health conscious person
                          I found chiropractic benefited my health, yoga practice and running
                          greatly. After the chiropractic treatment, I found my flexibility
                          increased greatly. There were some yoga postures I could not achieve,
                          but after chiropractic adjustment I could immediately and effortlessly
                          do them. Before I discovered chiropractic my neck always felt stiff from
                          long hours of typing at work. I tried to treat this many ways myself but
                          they never worked. However after the chiropractic treatment my neck feels
                          like new and the stiffness is gone. Now chiropractic has become a necessary
                          part of my healthy lifestyle.

                          Dr Rosenstein has offered me great relief for the stress and strain I
                          experience in my neck and upper back caused by sitting at a computer all day.
                          I find that regular visits help me to maintain my health and comfort.

                          I want to say thank you for all the times I have visited
                          you for relief from the pain in my back and neck. Some
                          of the pain is from arthritis and some from tension. You
                          always find the spot where the knot is and then are able to
                          work it out. Your the best!

                          Dr. Rosenstein is an exceptionally talented chiropractor.
                          He has helped me through a number of neck and back injuries
                          and has helped restore my quality of life. When I fist started
                          working with him several years ago, getting out of bed and walking
                          was a painful struggle. With his help, I am healthy again,
                          so much so that I have completed the NYC Marathon in 2010.
                          His success with patients comes not only from his excellent
                          adjustments, but his interest in the individual and they activities.
                          For example, he helped me to modify my workout routine to modify
                          some exercises that were causing more harm than good.
                          I recommend him to my friends with no reservations.
